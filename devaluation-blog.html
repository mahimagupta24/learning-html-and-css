                  Every country has different monetary policies that are different than the other country’s policies. They can have a semi-fixed exchange rate or a fixed exchange rate. Also, these terms are often misunderstood with depreciation in contrast to re-evaluation.</p>

<p>Thus, in other words, a currency is called devalued when it loses the relative value with other currencies in the foreign market. Also, it can be said that the devaluation of the currency is a result of its monetary policy.</p>
<h2>Objectives of Devaluation of the Currency</h2>
<ul>
  <li>To encourage the flow of capital into the country from outside i.e foreign countries.</li>
  <li>It is done to improve the balance of payment position due to the reduced imports and increase in exports.</li>
  <li>To increase the competitiveness of the services and goods exported outside the country.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  The government that issues the currency decides to devalue the currency. Also, unlike the depreciation, this one is not the result of any nongovernmental activities. Also, the other reason is a country devalues it’s the currency to combat the imbalance in trade.
</p>
<p>
  Thus, devaluation reduces the cost of the country’s exports. Also, it provides them with a more competitive market and this, in turn, increases the cost of imports. So, domestic consumers are likely to purchase them and thus it further strengthens the domestic business.
</p>
<p>As imports decrease and exports increase,  a favors a balance of payment towards the shrinking trade deficits. Thus, a country devalues it’s currency so that it can reduce the deficit because it increases the demand for cheaper exports.</p>
